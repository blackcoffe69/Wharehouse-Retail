# Warehouse-Retail


## Project Overview

### Aim to analyze product performance trends over a specified period, assessing sales data from warehouse to retail. By examining monthly sales data, I seek to identify the top-selling products and understand their performance dynamics.

## Data Source

### The Data is sourced from Data.gov

[Link to Data Source](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/warehouse-and-retail-sales")

## Tool Used

 - Python (Jupyter Notebook)

## Analysis 

 - Checked dataset for emptiness, duplicates, replaced null values, verified data types, assessed dataset dimensions, and reviewed variable names for clarity.

 - Analyzing warehouse sales data to pinpoint the month with the highest performance and identify the retail company with the most robust product supply.

 - Visualizing trend and pattern of sales by number of month.

 - Visualize warehouse sales volume of item types by year for analysis.

 - Analyze and visualize item types by supplier with corresponding counts.

 - Assessing yearly patterns to identify increases in warehouse sales by item type.

 - Analyzing and visualizing retail sales by product over the years to highlight the year with the highest sales value.

- The line + scatter analysis indicates fluctuating trends in sales: Month 1 peaked at 1,109,919.19 but declined in Month 2, 
showcasing instability. Months 4 and 12 witnessed the lowest sales. Month 7 recorded the highest sales at 1.109919M, 
but momentum waned afterward, with sales attempting to recover post-Month 8 with value of 306,957.22.

- The bar chart analysis of item types by year for warehouse sales highlights 2019 as the top-performing year. 
Wine led the sales with 84,271, followed by Beer 19,787, Liquor 28538, Non-alcoholic 907,STR_SUPPLIES 209 and REF 60. Conversely, 2018 recorded
the lowest sales across categories. This reveals Beer as the most demanded product, suggesting potential investment opportunities in this category.

- The bar chart illustrates the supplier distribution, with REPUBLIC NATIONAL DISTRIBUTING CO leading with a count of 20,995, 
followed by LEGENDS LTD with 13,639, SOUTHERN GLAZERS WINE AND SPIRITS with 11,720, E & J GALLO WINERY with 10,816, and THE COUNTRY VINTNER, 
LLC DBA WINEBOW with 10,669. This analysis underscores the dominance of wine suppliers among the top performers. Considering the high demand 
for wine in retail sales, there is an opportunity to explore strategies to further promote wine consumption in collaboration with these key suppliers.

- This line chart presents the trend of item types over the years, commencing from 2017 with a stable trajectory. However, a notable decline occurred in 2018,
  which was effectively addressed, leading to a consistent upward trend until 2020. This indicates successful mitigation of challenges encountered in 2018,
  resulting in overall enhancement of item types over the years. Recommendations are sought to further fortify strategies and sustain the positive trajectory
  in the future.

- The stacked bar chart visualizes retail sales of item types over the years, with 2019 exhibiting the highest sales figures: Liquor leading with 357.0774k,
  followed by Wine at 325.1128k, Beer at 262.4797k, and Non-Alcoholic at 13.98473k. Conversely, 2018 recorded the lowest sales, with Wine at 59.20211k,
  Liquor at 57.43218k, and Beer at 35.24664k; Non-Alcoholic items saw no sales during this period. Post-2019, a decline in retail sales is evident,
  warranting further analysis to devise strategies for enhancing sales moving forward.
